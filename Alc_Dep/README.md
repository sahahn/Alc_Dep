Note: This repository is included as only a reference for code run in analysis for the paper "Predicting Alcohol Dependence from Multi-Site Brain Structural Measures", the caveat is this represents incomplete research code. This is due to a number of reasons: an inabbility to share the underlying data, the length of the project / different iterations and directions analysis took (contributing to my own disorginzation), and that a great deal of analysis (e.g., the evolutionary searches) were written to be run on on a computing cluster. For the listed reasons, it would likely be very difficult if not impossible for an interested party to reproduce the analysis conducted from just this shared code, I instead encourage anyone interested to please reach out to me at sahahn@uvm.edu, and I can either prepare a more user friendly version of the analysis conducted, or point you towards new packages I have been developing. Thanks!
